# PS4_Consumer_Analytics

## About this Project:
I was curious about how well PS4 games sold around the world, so I found a consumer dataset from VGChartz which depicts the total sales around multiple regions in the world. The Excel sheet provides data on Game (Name),	Platform (PS4),	Year(Published),	Genre,	Publisher, and Regions (North America, Europe, Japan, and the Rest of World). I wanted to practice my technical and analytical skills, so have at my work and feel free to use or give me feedback on my work.
